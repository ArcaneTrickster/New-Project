<li>First we created app <code>ng new New-Project</code></li>
<li>we created app.routing.module.ts. see app.routing.module.ts to know how it works.</li>
<li>Our App will Have a login/registration page, and then we will be directed to actual app which has an Admin panel with routing to different pages. <ul>
<li>see App-Structure.png. , app.routing.module.ts. , and further child routes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As you can see in app.routing.module.ts , RegistrationComponent,DashboardComponent,LoginComponent,AdminLayoutComponent,AuthLayoutComponent;
     are loaded with app load and features component is lazy loaded.
      for lazy loading to work, you need a seperate features.module.ts,its routing.module.ts. and import respective component,RouterModule,FeaturesRoutingModule.</li>
<li>I did <code>ng add @angular/material</code> in console to add angular material into my project. I have also created a module using <code>ng g m [module_name]</code>
    to create material.module.ts where i will keep all my angular material imports.</li>
</ol>
